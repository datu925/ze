  "text"=>"Donald Trump had another bone to pick with the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal on Thursday. \n
  The Republican frontrunner previously picked a fight with the editorial board last November, when it critiqued his positions on trade. He has also criticized polls co-sponsored by the Journal that show him behind rivals or losing ground, in February deeming one a \"Rupert Murdoch hit,\" referring to the publication's owner.\nThis time, he is taking the newspaper to task for publishing actual voting results showing that he has received fewer overall votes in the Republican primary than Hillary Clinton has in the Democratic primary.\n\"A GOP convention can’t steal something Mr. Trump doesn’t own. Since 1860 the rules have required a candidate to have a delegate majority to win on the first ballot—not a mere plurality. If a candidate fails, the rules allow delegates to support someone else. If Mr. Trump can’t win a majority of Republicans, he can’t win a majority of Americans in November,\" the board wrote in the piece published Wednesday evening, adding, \"By the way, Hillary Clinton’s primary vote total so far is 8,646,551, according to the Real Clear Politics count. Mr. Trump’s is 7,533,692.\"\nTrump took umbrage at the last line, taking to Twitter on Thursday morning with a three-part tirade against the paper's editorial board. \n\".@WSJ Editorial says \"Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692\"-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize,\" Trump tweeted, adding in subsequent messages, \"@WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!\"\nBut even after professing not to care what the paper says in its editorials, Trump followed up 11 minutes later, \"Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them!\"
  \nA spokeswoman for the newspaper did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n
